## Non-Users

This application is NOT designed for:
- Teams or organizations (no multi-user support)
- Businesses tracking company subscriptions (no account management)
- Users needing mobile-first experience (web-focused)
- Users requiring API access (no API planned)
- Users needing real-time bank integration (manual entry only)

## Future Consideration

While currently designed for personal use, the architecture could potentially support:
- Household sharing (multiple family members viewing same data)
- Export/import for backup or migration

However, these are not current priorities and would require significant additions to the architecture.
